      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;understanding-expected-value-outside-betting&#34;&gt;Understanding Expected Value Outside Betting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing gambling, investing, or decision-making under uncertainty, the term &lt;em&gt;expected value&lt;/em&gt; frequently arises. Most often, expected value (EV) is linked to betting scenarios, where it helps bettors evaluate the quality of different wagers. However, expected value extends far beyond traditional betting and plays a crucial role in various arenas, including finance, insurance, sports strategies, and data-driven markets. This article explores what expected value means outside betting, why it matters, and how understanding it can improve decision-making where uncertainty and risk are involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why does it matter for people placing bets or making predictions? Understanding liquidity helps you see how prices form, how easy it is to enter or exit positions, and why certain markets behave the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Betting limits are a common feature in sports betting and prediction markets. When sharp bettors—those consistently well-informed and successful in wagering—encounter limits on their bets, it often sparks frustration or confusion. Are these limits a way for sportsbooks or platforms to punish winners? Or do they play a different role, perhaps even a useful one for all participants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of sports betting and prediction markets, two metrics often stand out in discussions: win rate and closing line value (CLV). While many casual bettors focus on their win rate—the percentage of bets they win—more experienced and analytical bettors pay close attention to closing line value. Understanding why CLV matters more than simple win rate can deepen your grasp of how sharp bettors operate and why markets move as they do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
